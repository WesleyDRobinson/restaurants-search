### Question 1:
    Hello,
    I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
    - Records
    - Indexing

    I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

    Cheers,
    George

    Hey George,

    Thanks for reaching out!

    An index is an entity within Algolia where you import the data you want to search (indexing) and perform queries against (search).
    And each item stored within an index is a record.
    To dive deeper and find more helpful info, [check out the documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/what-is-algolia/?language=php#vocabulary).

### Question 2:
    Hello,

    Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

    Regards,
    Matt

    Hey Matt,

    The design team takes this kind of feedback seriously, and I'll be sure to pass this along.
    I also want to make sure you've seen the [Indexing API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/indexing/), which allows you to perform these operations programatically.
    It might make your iteration even quicker!

    Let me know what you think and if you need any additional help around this topic.

    Cheers,
    Wesley


### Question 3:
    Hi,

    I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

    Hey Leo,

    Thanks for writing in!

    At a high level, you'll need to structure your data for search and submit it to Algolia for indexing.
    It's very quick to implement a basic search with Algolia's API's and helper libraries.
    From there, you can start refining the index to enhance search relevancy, and this can be an ongoing process as well.

    I can help get you started down the right path.
    Can you tell me a bit more about your search goals and current data?

    Regards,
    Wesley
